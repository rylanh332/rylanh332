# Android App Project Outline
### **Project Description**: 
Timber is an app that acts as an entertaining and productive way to find your perfect house. Given certain constraints by the user, Timber will show the user certain houses that meet their criteria. By swiping left or right on selective houses within your chosen location, users can decide whether they are interested in the house or not. This app serves to innovate the unchanged housing market by revitalizing the house-finding process.

### **Problem Addressing**: 
Finding houses within your area takes a lot of work. Today, it can take a long time to find your favorite house. While sites like Zillow hold a monopoly on finding your perfect house, I believe this product can be downsized into a mobile application. Making the prospect of finding your dream house fun and accessible through a mobile app will surely fix the lethargic battle of finding it through other sites. Timber will make it easy by allowing users to input specific criteria and work through houses that meet them. 

### **Platform**: 
I will start by taking my app to the Android Play Store first. I will be using an Android Application IDE to begin the development of the app. Eventually, it would be good to replicate the app onto the iOS game store too. Thus after the first version is submitted to the Android Store, I will begin work on the iOS version. I wish to make this application as easily accessible as possible and available on as many Android and Apple phones as possible.

### **Front/Back End Support**: 
Front-end I wish to make the application appear similar to the dating app Tinder. I believe their style is very easy to incorporate and simple for many users. By looking at a rolling picture format that shows various views of the house, a user can swipe left or right to determine if the house is a good fit. By swiping left or right, the back-end technology will save the house to the user’s profile, allowing the user to return to it at a later date. Furthermore, restrictions can be set in place on the front end that filter the houses that can show up on the back end.

### **Functionality**: There will be a couple of things a user can do on my platform:
- Log in / sign up using your username, email, phone number, and password.
- Set filters for the houses they wish to see such as price, # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms, location, etc
- Swipe through available houses that meet their requirements, determining at the moment if they like it or not. This saves the house for a later viewing date on their profile
- View saved houses on their profile to further narrow down which house they truly want through their favorites
- Ideally, there is also a contact page for realtors or those who the user can contact about actually purchasing the house
### **Design (Wireframes)**: The wireframes can be seen on this outline's document with the link below
